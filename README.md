# Point-Generation-in-Absolute-Accuracy-Calibration-of-ABB-Robots
This script uses movej motion data in RAPID to generate 100 points and applies filtering.
A method that relies on ten point coordinates to generate RAPID code for the robot to achieve point creation. The current code does not include the robot's forward and inverse kinematics or its motion kinematics.
